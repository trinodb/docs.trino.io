# SET ROLE

## Synopsis

```text
SET ROLE ( role | ALL | NONE )
[ IN catalog ]
```

## Description

`SET ROLE` sets the enabled role for the current session.

`SET ROLE role` enables a single specified role for the current session.
For the `SET ROLE role` statement to succeed, the user executing it should
have a grant for the given role.

`SET ROLE ALL` enables all roles that the current user has been granted for the
current session.

`SET ROLE NONE` disables all the roles granted to the current user for the
current session.

The optional `IN catalog` clause sets the role in a catalog as opposed
to a system role.

## Limitations

Some connectors do not support role management.

# SPI overview

When you implement a new Trino plugin, you implement interfaces and
override methods defined by the Service Provider Interface (SPI).

Plugins can provide additional:

- {doc}`connectors`,
- block encodings,
- {doc}`types`,
- {doc}`functions`,
- {doc}`system-access-control`,
- {doc}`group-provider`,
- {doc}`password-authenticator`,
- {doc}`header-authenticator`,
- {doc}`certificate-authenticator`,
- {doc}`event-listener`,
- resource group configuration managers,
- session property configuration managers,
- and exchange managers.

In particular, connectors are the source of all data for queries in
Trino: they back each catalog available to Trino.

## Code

The SPI source can be found in the `core/trino-spi` directory in the Trino
source tree.

## Plugin metadata

Each plugin identifies an entry point: an implementation of the
`Plugin` interface. This class name is provided to Trino via
the standard Java `ServiceLoader` interface: the classpath contains
a resource file named `io.trino.spi.Plugin` in the
`META-INF/services` directory. The content of this file is a
single line listing the name of the plugin class:

```text
com.example.plugin.ExamplePlugin
```

For a built-in plugin that is included in the Trino source code,
this resource file is created whenever the `pom.xml` file of a plugin
contains the following line:

```xml
<packaging>trino-plugin</packaging>
```

## Plugin

The `Plugin` interface is a good starting place for developers looking
to understand the Trino SPI. It contains access methods to retrieve
various classes that a Plugin can provide. For example, the `getConnectorFactories()`
method is a top-level function that Trino calls to retrieve a `ConnectorFactory` when Trino
is ready to create an instance of a connector to back a catalog. There are similar
methods for `Type`, `ParametricType`, `Function`, `SystemAccessControl`, and
`EventListenerFactory` objects.

## Building plugins via Maven

Plugins depend on the SPI from Trino:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.trino</groupId>
    <artifactId>trino-spi</artifactId>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

The plugin uses the Maven `provided` scope because Trino provides
the classes from the SPI at runtime and thus the plugin should not
include them in the plugin assembly.

There are a few other dependencies that are provided by Trino,
including Slice and Jackson annotations. In particular, Jackson is
used for serializing connector handles and thus plugins must use the
annotations version provided by Trino.

All other dependencies are based on what the plugin needs for its
own implementation. Plugins are loaded in a separate class loader
to provide isolation and to allow plugins to use a different version
of a library that Trino uses internally.

For an example `pom.xml` file, see the example HTTP connector in the
`plugin/trino-example-http` directory in the Trino source tree.

## Deploying a custom plugin

Because Trino plugins use the `trino-plugin` packaging type, building
a plugin will create a ZIP file in the `target` directory. This file
contains the plugin JAR and all its dependencies JAR files.

In order to add a custom plugin to a Trino installation, extract the plugin
ZIP file and move the extracted directory into the Trino plugin directory.
For example, for a plugin called `my-functions`, with a version of 1.0,
you would extract `my-functions-1.0.zip` and then move `my-functions-1.0`
to `my-functions` in the Trino plugin directory.

:::{note}
Every Trino plugin should be in a separate directory. Do not put JAR files
directly into the `plugin` directory. Plugins should only contain JAR files,
so any subdirectories will not be traversed and will be ignored.
:::

By default, the plugin directory is the `plugin` directory relative to the
directory in which Trino is installed, but it is configurable using the
configuration variable `plugin.dir`. In order for Trino to pick up
the new plugin, you must restart Trino.

Plugins must be installed on all nodes in the Trino cluster (coordinator and workers).

```

## Description

columns of the table.

columns of all current and future tables of the schema.

## Examples

Deny `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on the table `orders`
to user `alice`:

```
DENY INSERT, SELECT ON orders TO alice;
```

Deny `DELETE` privilege on the schema `finance` to user `bob`:

```
DENY DELETE ON SCHEMA finance TO bob;
```

Deny `SELECT` privilege on the table `orders` to everyone:

```

```

## Limitations

in Trino have no support for `DENY`.

# SET PATH

## Synopsis

```text
SET PATH path-element[, ...]
```

## Description

Define a collection of paths to functions or table functions in specific
catalogs and schemas for the current session.

Each path-element uses a period-separated syntax to specify the catalog name and
schema location `<catalog>.<schema>` of the function, or only the schema
location `<schema>` in the current catalog. The current catalog is set with
{doc}`use`, or as part of a client tool connection. Catalog and schema must
exist.

## Examples

The following example sets a path to access functions in the `system` schema
of the `example` catalog:

```
SET PATH example.system;
```

The catalog uses the PostgreSQL connector, and you can therefore use the
{ref}`query table function <postgresql-query-function>` directly, without the
full catalog and schema qualifiers:

```
SELECT
  *
FROM
  TABLE(
    query(
      query => 'SELECT
        *
      FROM
        tpch.nation'
    )
  );
```

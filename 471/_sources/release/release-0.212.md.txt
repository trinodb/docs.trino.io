# Release 0.212

## General

- Fix query failures when the {func}`ST_GeomFromBinary` function is run on multiple rows.
- Fix memory accounting for the build side of broadcast joins.
- Fix occasional query failures when running `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`.
- Enhance {func}`ST_ConvexHull` and {func}`convex_hull_agg` functions to support geometry collections.
- Improve performance for some queries using `DISTINCT`.
- Improve performance for some queries that perform filtered global aggregations.
- Remove `round(x, d)` and `truncate(x, d)` functions where `d` is a `BIGINT` ({issue}`x11462`).
- Add {func}`ST_LineString` function to form a `LineString` from an array of points.

## Hive connector

- Prevent ORC writer from writing stripes larger than the max configured size for some rare data
  patterns ({issue}`x11526`).
- Restrict the maximum line length for text files. The default limit of 100MB can be changed
  using the `hive.text.max-line-length` configuration property.
- Add sanity checks that fail queries if statistics read from the metastore are corrupt. Corrupt
  statistics can be ignored by setting the `hive.ignore-corrupted-statistics`
  configuration property or the `ignore_corrupted_statistics` session property.

## Thrift connector

- Fix retry for network errors that occur while sending a Thrift request.
- Remove failed connections from connection pool.

## Verifier

- Record the query ID of the test query regardless of query outcome.

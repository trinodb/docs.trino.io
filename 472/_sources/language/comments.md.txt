# Comments

## Synopsis

Comments are part of a SQL statement or script that are ignored for processing.
Comments begin with double dashes and extend to the end of the line. Block
comments begin with `/*` and extend to the next occurrence of `*/`, possibly
spanning over multiple lines.

## Examples

The following example displays a comment line, a comment after a valid
statement, and a block comment:

```sql
-- This is a comment.
SELECT * FROM table; -- This comment is ignored.

/* This is a block comment
   that spans multiple lines
   until it is closed. */
```

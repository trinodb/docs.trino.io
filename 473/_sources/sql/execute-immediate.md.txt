# EXECUTE IMMEDIATE

## Synopsis

```text
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE `statement` [ USING parameter1 [ , parameter2, ... ] ]
```

## Description

Executes a statement without the need to prepare or deallocate the statement.
Parameter values are defined in the `USING` clause.

## Examples

Execute a query with no parameters:

```
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
'SELECT name FROM nation';
```

Execute a query with two parameters:

```
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE
'SELECT name FROM nation WHERE regionkey = ? and nationkey < ?'
USING 1, 3;
```

This is equivalent to:

```
PREPARE statement_name FROM SELECT name FROM nation WHERE regionkey = ? and nationkey < ?
EXECUTE statement_name USING 1, 3
DEALLOCATE PREPARE statement_name
```

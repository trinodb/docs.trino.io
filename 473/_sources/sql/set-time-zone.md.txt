# SET TIME ZONE

## Synopsis

```text
SET TIME ZONE LOCAL
SET TIME ZONE expression
```

## Description

Sets the default time zone for the current session.

If the `LOCAL` option is specified, the time zone for the current session
is set to the initial time zone of the session.

If the `expression` option is specified:

- if the type of the `expression` is a string, the time zone for the current
  session is set to the corresponding region-based time zone ID or the
  corresponding zone offset.
- if the type of the `expression` is an interval, the time zone for the
  current session is set to the corresponding zone offset relative to UTC.
  It must be in the range of \[-14,14\] hours.

## Examples

Use the default time zone for the current session:

```
SET TIME ZONE LOCAL;
```

Use a zone offset for specifying the time zone:

```
SET TIME ZONE '-08:00';
```

Use an interval literal for specifying the time zone:

```
SET TIME ZONE INTERVAL '10' HOUR;
SET TIME ZONE INTERVAL -'08:00' HOUR TO MINUTE;
```

Use a region-based time zone identifier for specifying the time zone:

```
SET TIME ZONE 'America/Los_Angeles';
```

The time zone identifier to be used can be passed as the output of a
function call:

```
SET TIME ZONE concat_ws('/', 'America', 'Los_Angeles');
```

## Limitations

Setting the default time zone for the session has no effect if
the `sql.forced-session-time-zone` configuration property is already set.

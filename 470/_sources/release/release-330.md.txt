# Release 330 (18 Feb 2020)

## General

- Fix incorrect behavior of {func}`format` for `char` values. Previously, the function
  did not preserve trailing whitespace of the value being formatted. ({issue}`2629`)
- Fix query failure in some cases when aggregation uses inputs from both sides of a join. ({issue}`2560`)
- Fix query failure when dynamic filtering is enabled and the query contains complex
  multi-level joins. ({issue}`2659`)
- Fix query failure for certain co-located joins when dynamic filtering is enabled. ({issue}`2685`)
- Fix failure of `SHOW` statements or queries that access `information_schema` schema tables
  with an empty value used in a predicate. ({issue}`2575`)
- Fix query failure when {doc}`/sql/execute` is used with an expression containing a function call. ({issue}`2675`)
- Fix failure in `SHOW CATALOGS` when the user does not have permissions to see any catalogs. ({issue}`2593`)
- Improve query performance for some join queries when {doc}`/optimizer/cost-based-optimizations`
  are enabled. ({issue}`2722`)
- Prevent uneven distribution of data that can occur when writing data with redistribution or writer
  scaling enabled. ({issue}`2788`)
- Add support for `CREATE VIEW` with comment ({issue}`2557`)
- Add support for all major geometry types to {func}`ST_Points`. ({issue}`2535`)
- Add `required_workers_count` and `required_workers_max_wait_time` session properties
  to control the number of workers that must be present in the cluster before query
  processing starts. ({issue}`2484`)
- Add `physical_input_bytes` column to `system.runtime.tasks` table. ({issue}`2803`)
- Verify that the target schema exists for the {doc}`/sql/use` statement. ({issue}`2764`)
- Verify that the session catalog exists when executing {doc}`/sql/set-role`. ({issue}`2768`)

## Server

- Require running on {ref}`Java 11 or above <requirements-java>`. This requirement may be temporarily relaxed by adding
  `-Dpresto-temporarily-allow-java8=true` to the Presto {ref}`jvm-config`.
  This fallback will be removed in future versions of Presto after March 2020. ({issue}`2751`)
- Add experimental support for running on Linux aarch64 (ARM64). ({issue}`2809`)

## Security

- {ref}`system-file-auth-principal-rules` are deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
  These rules have been replaced with {doc}`/security/user-mapping`, which
  specifies how a complex authentication user name is mapped to a simple
  user name for Presto, and {ref}`system-file-auth-impersonation-rules` which
  control the ability of a user to impersonate another user. ({issue}`2215`)
- A shared secret is now required when using {doc}`/security/internal-communication`. ({issue}`2202`)
- Kerberos for {doc}`/security/internal-communication` has been replaced with the new shared secret mechanism.
  The `internal-communication.kerberos.enabled` and `internal-communication.kerberos.use-canonical-hostname`
  configuration properties must be removed. ({issue}`2202`)
- When authentication is disabled, the Presto user may now be set using standard
  HTTP basic authentication with an empty password. ({issue}`2653`)

## Web UI

- Display physical read time in detailed query view. ({issue}`2805`)

## JDBC driver

- Fix a performance issue on JDK 11+ when connecting using HTTP/2. ({issue}`2633`)
- Implement `PreparedStatement.setTimestamp()` variant that takes a `Calendar`. ({issue}`2732`)
- Add `roles` property for catalog authorization roles. ({issue}`2780`)
- Add `sessionProperties` property for setting system and catalog session properties. ({issue}`2780`)
- Add `clientTags` property to set client tags for selecting resource groups. ({issue}`2468`)
- Allow using the `:` character within an extra credential value specified via the
  `extraCredentials` property. ({issue}`2780`)

## CLI

- Fix a performance issue on JDK 11+ when connecting using HTTP/2. ({issue}`2633`)

## Cassandra connector

- Fix query failure when identifiers should be quoted. ({issue}`2455`)

## Hive connector

- Fix reading symlinks from HDFS when using Kerberos. ({issue}`2720`)
- Reduce Hive metastore load when updating partition statistics. ({issue}`2734`)
- Allow redistributing writes for un-bucketed partitioned tables on the
  partition keys, which results in a single writer per partition. This reduces
  memory usage, results in a single file per partition, and allows writing a
  large number of partitions (without hitting the open writer limit). However,
  writing large partitions with a single writer can take substantially longer, so
  this feature should only be enabled when required. To enable this feature, set the
  `use-preferred-write-partitioning` system configuration property or the
  `use_preferred_write_partitioning` system session property to `true`. ({issue}`2358`)
- Remove extra file status call after writing text-based, SequenceFile, or Avro file types. ({issue}`1748`)
- Allow using writer scaling with all file formats. Previously, it was not supported for
  text-based, SequenceFile, or Avro formats. ({issue}`2657`)
- Add support for symlink-based tables with Avro files. ({issue}`2720`)
- Add support for ignoring partitions with a non-existent data directory. This can be configured
  using the `hive.ignore-absent-partitions=true` configuration property or the
  `ignore_absent_partitions` session property. ({issue}`2555`)
- Allow creation of external tables with data via `CREATE TABLE AS` when
  both `hive.non-managed-table-creates-enabled` and `hive.non-managed-table-writes-enabled`
  are set to `true`. Previously this required executing `CREATE TABLE` and `INSERT`
  as separate statement ({issue}`2669`)
- Add support for Azure WASB, ADLS Gen1 (ADL) and ADLS Gen2 (ABFS) file systems. ({issue}`2494`)
- Add experimental support for executing basic Hive views. To enable this feature, the
  `hive.views-execution.enabled` configuration property must be set to `true`. ({issue}`2715`)
- Add {ref}`register_partition <register-partition>` and {ref}`unregister_partition <unregister-partition>`
  procedures for adding partitions to and removing partitions from a partitioned table. ({issue}`2692`)
- Allow running {doc}`/sql/analyze` collecting only basic table statistics. ({issue}`2762`)

## Elasticsearch connector

- Improve performance of queries containing a `LIMIT` clause. ({issue}`2781`)
- Add support for `nested` data type. ({issue}`754`)

## PostgreSQL connector

- Add read support for PostgreSQL `money` data type. The type is mapped to `varchar` in Presto.
  ({issue}`2601`)

## Other connectors

These changes apply to the MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Phoenix and SQL Server connectors.

- Respect `DEFAULT` column clause when writing to a table. ({issue}`1185`)

## SPI

- Allow procedures to have optional arguments with default values. ({issue}`2706`)
- `SystemAccessControl.checkCanSetUser()` is deprecated and has been replaced
  with {doc}`/security/user-mapping` and `SystemAccessControl.checkCanImpersonateUser()`. ({issue}`2215`)
